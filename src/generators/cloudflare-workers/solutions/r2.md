# Development Notes 

When using Cloudflare R2 in development mode, make certain to use the `--remote` option, e.g.;

```
npm run dev --remote
``` 

Or you will be unable to access the R2 bucket 


# Configuration 

Also if you are testing using the production bucket, you still need to specify the `preview_bucket_name`. 

```
	"r2_buckets": [
		{
			"binding": "IMAGES_BUCKET",
			"bucket_name": "upload",
			"preview_bucket_name": "upload",
			"remote": true
		}
	]
```
