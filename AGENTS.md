This package creates Claude skills and references in developer projects. 

It is delivered as an NPM repo, which will be included in other projects typically Webflow code components, or Webflow cloud projects.  The developer will periodically execute this to update their Claude skills in that project.

Primary goals are;

1. To deliver the core documentation knowledge regarding the subject area the developer requires.  These are represented as generators here. 
2. To deliver other efficiencies that make Claude work better for developers.
