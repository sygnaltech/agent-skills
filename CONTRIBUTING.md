I'm adding developer knowledge to my Claude agent-skills repo for @webflow. 

Do you know an important detail, solution approach, or developer tip that isn't covered in the official docs?  Share it!  Let's make Claude smarter, together. 
The repo is currently still focused on educating Claude about the 4 official @webflow developer interfaces; 

1. Code components
2. Data API
3. Designer API
4. Webflow cloud

WHAT I'M LOOKING FOR...
Anything that's important to Webflow developers, which isn't general knowledge, e.g.; 
- Tips on using specific CMS API field types 
- Tips on how to correctly prepare rich text content to support figures, images, unordered lists and more 
- Limitations on what can't be handled, e.g. code blocks and embeds 
- Development, testing, and deployment tips around leveraging Cloud, or versioning Code Components 
- Anything that Claude isn't clearly picking up from the official docs, like the distinction between /live publishing endpoints, or how to use Data API endpoints that focus on localization
